Before you ask, all buttons on this website are inspired by Windows 7.

I have done my fair share of startup too, my last Startup was LearnCodeOnline where we served 350,000+ user with various courses and best part was that we are able to offer these courses are pricing of 299-399 INR, crazy right üò±?
